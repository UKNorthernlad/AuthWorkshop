# Lab2 - Build Applications

## Exercise 3 - Single Page Web Applications
In this 4th exercise you will create a typical **Single Page Application** which will pull data from an backend API. Whilst this may appear to be similar to Exercise 2 there is one important difference. This application is unable to securely store a "secret" (as the user could view the source code at any time) therefore a different "flow" must be used to obtain the id/access token.
