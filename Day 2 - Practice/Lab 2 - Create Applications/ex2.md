# Lab2 - Build Applications

## Exercise 2 - Confidential Client Application that uses a backend API
The next logical step is to build an application that runs on a server but needs to talk to a remote API in the context of the logged-on user. To do this you need to make two key changes:

1. Define the backend API as its own unique client application in KeyCloak.
2. Configure KeyCloak to understand that the FrontEnd application (myfirstapp) and the BackEnd API (backendAPI) are related and when users login to the FrontEnd application, they are prompted to consent to an access token being issued for the BackEnd API.
3. Configure the BackEnd API application to trust access tokens issued by KeyCloak and to check tokens contain a valid `scope`.

### Task 1 - A Node.js application that uses KeyCloak and talks to a backend API.
